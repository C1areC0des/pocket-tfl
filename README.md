# Pocket TFL

## Project Aim

The idea is to create an app that is actually useful to me (and maybe others). Keeping it simple with functionality I actually need.

- Display the line status at a glance
- Get departure times for specific stations
- Plan a journey from a to b

## Stack

Vanilla JS, CSS and a little HTML

## API
